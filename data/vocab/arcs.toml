Then a third member joined the duo, and in so doing brought some shape:

```
In time their couplet was naught
The club's rank increased by one
This dyadic lot hitherto
A strange priesthood had become

Witness it wrought to our triad new
Where none there lie before
This exegetical scrawl now done
And balance askew never more

Some time passed and then trio was addressed, "Brethren! It hath reached me that this man Publius knows much I do not." The others confessed that though they marveled at his words, there were many gaps in their own understanding. The problem lie in the detailed references to events long past. Thus it agreed an adventure should be undertaken, in search of a beginning no matter how long it took or what the cost; the prize would be that they may better understand their present day.
