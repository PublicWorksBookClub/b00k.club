This was the first arc and existed before the arcs themselves were even conceived. Before then there was no book club, only public works. One of us was in one kind of exile, while the other, was in another. In any case, one day it had been decided to read the same things and talk about them. From this nothingness came chaos that quickly took a shape, and thus from it's very first moments the book club was meant to be one that would read all kinds of literature from the public domain.

We lept and landed in the midst of a tremendous and tragic conflict that consumed all of Hellas in its twisting and turning, as did our priesthood for the public did not always work.
