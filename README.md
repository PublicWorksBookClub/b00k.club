## Usage

Here's how you do stuff:

```zsh
# installs everything that you need
npm install

# builds once, output will be in the `public` directory
# Use BUILD_OPTS to pass options to the zola build command
npm run build

# starts a local server that binds to `0.0.0.0:1111`, and watches the respective directories and rebuilds upon every change
# Use SERVE_OPTS to pass options to the zola serve command
npm run serve
```

For example, you can run `npm run serve` and then go to `localhost:1111` in your browser to see the websites. As you make changes to the code or content, the website will be updated.

## Updates

Any changes need to recorded in the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) file, with the corresponding version number reflected in the [package.json](package.json) file.

Some notes on versioning:

- adding content to existing links is just a bump in patch version, i.e. `nn.nn.++`
- changing links, including anchors, is a bump in minor version, i.e. `nn.++.nn`
- fundamental changes in the site's tech, that makes it incompatible with prior versions is a change in major version, i.e. `++.nn.nn`

For example, releasing a huge new initiative to launch our theoretical youtube channel would be a minor version change, however keeping the site exactly the same but moving the static site generator from zola to hugo would be a major version change.

(These guidelines are subject to change 😂)

## Content

Content is stored in [markdown text](https://commonmark.org/help/) files located within the `content` directory. Files named `_index.md` are called "sections", and files by any other name ending in `.md` are called "pages". For more information you can read the [zola](https://getzola.com) documentation. It is written in markdown and inserted into the html via the "[template](#templates)", which is indicated on the top of the content.

### Bibliography

There's a [pwbc.bib](/pwbc.bib) file that meant to store bibliography data and then referenced throughout the cite. The bibliography itself is generated by [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) with the [Better BibTex](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) plugin, and exported to BibLaTex format. Small edits are easy to make manually, but for larger changes it's recommended to import the `pwbc.bib` file and do the work with the same setup.

Items in the bibliography can be referenced via [shortcodes](/templates/shortcodes/) or [macros](/templates/macro/), depending on if they're being referenced from within content or a template.

## Templates

Templates are in the `templates` directory. Their purpose is to decide where in the html the content goes. The content is accessible to the template as a variable named either `section.content` or `page.content`, depending on the context.

## Styling

This website uses [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) for most of its styling. Additional styling can be added to the `css/input.css` file, but usually it is not necessary to add any custom styling. This file is read by tailwind which adds whatever additional styling is referenced in the html, resulting in a file called `style.css`, which is what is used by the website.

### Typography

The tailwind [typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) is used to style content that is generated from markdown. Any child elements that are nested within an element that has the class `prose` will receive the styling. The default styling can further be customized in the `@theme` directive located within `css/input.css`.

## Dependencies and Tools

- [zola](https://getzola.com)@0.20.0
- node@20.0.0
- [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/)@v4
- [tailwind typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin)
- [prettier](https://prettier.io)

## Deployments

This site is deployed using [Cloudflare pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com). Access is granted to the project's code repository by this site's admin's Cloudflare dash. When a branch is pushed a build is triggered and a new version of the site is deployed. If the branch is the "production" branch then the new version will be deployed at [https://b00k.club](https://b00k.club), otherwise it's deployed to some throwaway branch, usually a truncated version of the version's git branch.

Here are some additional things to know about deployments

- There is a file called `_headers` which is a convention used by Cloudflare pages to set HTTP headers for the static site
- `ZOLA_VERSION=0.20.0` must be explicitly set in Cloudflare pages build settings
- There's a file, `CHANGELOG.md`, that helps track what's changed as the site evolves

## Notes:

- This site was initially generated using a [GitHub template](https://github.com/asimpletune/zola-tailwindcss) for making zola static sites that work well with tailwindcss.
- The `npm run serve` script runs two long-running tasks in parallel and allows both to write simultaneously to STDOUT by using [a mixture of `wait` and sending jobs to the background](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-run-command-or-code-in-parallel-in-bash-shell-under-linux-or-unix/)
- Sometimes important changes for styling need to be made in the `@theme` directive
- Builds can break when deployed, and a common place to look is needing to add or update an environment variable for Cloudflare's "pages" product
