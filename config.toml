# these taxonomical terms are meant more to be used for classifying the texts that we've read in the club. Some taxonomies, such as `authors` may seem appropriate for other types of content, like /commentary, but the intention for now is to strictly use the following taxonomies only for content nested under /texts.
# more general, all-purpose taxonomies are further below

# (some texts may have more than one e.g. "First Philippic" and "Demosthenes 4")
[[taxonomies]]

feed = false

# (some texts may have more than one e.g. "Moses" and "Anonymous")
# (Note: Capitalize, always a proper now including with "Anonymous")
[[taxonomies]]
name = "authors"
feed = false

# The way the work is packaged (outside the content)
# e.g. play, dialogue, novel, epic poem, lyric poem, speech/oration, tetraology, letter/epistle, treatise, essay, fable, myth, history, commentary, manual, treatise, biography, tragedy (in terms of structure), comedy (in terms of structure), apologia, etc...
# (Note: lowercase)
[[taxonomies]]
name = "forms"
feed = false

# The mode of the work's content and its literary aim
# e.g. tragedy, myth, comedy, satire, sci-fi, folk tale, potrait, didactic, parable, allegory, romance, etc...
# (Note: lowercase)
[[taxonomies]]
name = "genres"
feed = false

# e.g. ethics, rhetoric, philosophy, political philosophy, mythology, how-to, etc...
# (Note: lowercase)
[[taxonomies]]
name = "subjects"
feed = false

# e.g. 4th c. BCE, enlightenment, middle eastern antiquity, renaissance, etc...
# (Note: capitalize historic periods but not centuries)
[[taxonomies]]
