# Notes

## From "The Older Sophists"

### From "79. Name and Notion"

The use of the word _sophist_ seems to have changed from pre-Socratic times. Many important "philosophers" (today's use of the word) of the day were referred as sophists by other writers. Additionally, the word _philosopher_ was used by Isocrates do describe orators such as himself and others with political skill. This reminds me of that passage in the Republic where there is shock at the suggestion that philosophers should rule. Socrates acknowledges his audience's apprehensions and blames society, dividing philosophers into two categories: vicious and useless. However Socrates himself was often referred to as a famous sophist in older writings.

In fact even Plato was called a sophist, although this may have been "by way of reproach".

> Does not Lysias [fr. 281 Orat.Att. 11 2i2a9] call Plato a “sophist,” and again Aeschines?

Lysias is connected with Plato by way of the Republic.

_Republic_ paints for us a solution to this dilemma. Sophists are those who use knowledge for its benefits whereas philosophers are those who truly love knowledge. In many ways the ostensible central question of _Republic_ concerning justice is analogous to this question of knowledge. Answers are hinted at throughout _Republic_ – I vaguely recall something along the lines of "if you love something you love all aspects of it" – but it may also be worthwhile to reflect on _Symposium_ as a more detailed treatment of the subject of love to understand what is meant by this.

_Euthyphro_ brings up a similar kind of conflict but about "the pious". The dialogue ends abruptly right as it feels like we're making progress, but one thread of the discussion before that was is if the gods love something because it is pious or whether something is pious because the gods love it. If I recall correctly the result was that it is not the case that the pious comes from the gods loving it.

Therefore we have something like this:

- Knowledge - loved by philosophers but philosophers don't create Knowledge simply by loving it
- Justice - loved by ? (the guardians? philosophers?) but valuable not for the benefits of seeming just but in its own right
- The Pious – loved by the gods

Back to the text

> No, I think that “sophist” was probably a general term, and “philosophy” had this meaning: a sort of love of the beautiful and study concerning discourse, and not this modern usage of the word, but culture in the universal sense

Further down, quoting Xenophon's _Memorabilia_

> the same with wisdom: those who sell it to anyone for money are called “sophists,” just like prostitutes.
