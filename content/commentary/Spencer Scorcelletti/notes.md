## Plato

Some interesting topics to write about

### Plato's writing

What are we even talking about when we talk about Plato's writings? By what rules do they play and how are they supposed to work? A good example to explain what I mean are all the things we're allowed to take for granted when reading a screenplay. They're almost like little script-shaped tapes that are meant to fit inside a human shaped slot that then plays them. The human comes with all the built-in machinery for how to "play" the movie in this script form. There is special syntax that's not shown literally in the actual movie that can direct the human script reader to imagine a new scene. In essence there is a reusable and universal set of rules about how a script works that the writer is allowed to take for granted and the reader is expected to already know. The question then is what are we talking about when we talk about Plato's writings? What _are_ they? How do they work?

Answering that question carries a certain amount of risk because we can never be absolutely sure. That being said there are still however a number of things that are absolutely certain. They are not the literal words of Socrates. Although he is frequently featured as a main character the platonic dialogues are absolutely a form of representational art. What are they representing? It can be said again with some certainty that Socrates serves as a character who exists to do socratic things like praise and question for the ultimate purpose of teaching a lesson.

Plato very famously believed and forcefully argued that knowledge simply couldn't be transferred and that real knowledge was gained in personal moments that we each have where something clicks for us. In this way the Platonic dialogues seem to be strange and different from other representational art in that they seem to strive for simulating that moment of epiphany within the reader themself. In this way it can be thought that whatever point one can directly argue a specific dialogue is about on the surface is almost certainly not what it's actually about; rather it's part of the story. The _real_ points are deep and meta. They're personal and very nuanced. There is always an air of plausible deniability. In that same way true knowledge lives beyond words.

Of course the ostensible subjects of each dialogue exist. We the audience are like a fly on the wall, privy to these ancient discussions that soon after we start them quickly fade into the background until they feel like a timeless candid moment between Socrates and his interlocutors. There is an uncanny feeling in them. Yet, Socrate's audience is not Plato's audience. While we're able to sit back and observe, over time we begin to become familiar with the genre. Like the human script player from earlier we begin to recognize and even anticipate the chains of argument and different forms of rhetoric that Plato uses. We recognize even at times the gentleness and eternal positivity that Socrates seemed to have held for anyone who would take the time to speak with him.

In this way Platonic dialogues are quite different from scripts because the reader invariably injects themself into the dialogue. The more you familiarize yourself with the genre the more active your own presence in the room feels. And yet, as I'm sure Plato was well aware, the book is static and will always do the same thing, whether you get it or not. This feature of Plato's writing is so strange and profound. How his dialogues manage to seem like they're adapting upon each new reading as you understand more and more without ever changing a word. Therefore when one considers what the dialogues are they must also take into consideration that Plato was aware of limitations of knowledge transfer and the limitations of writing.

If we work backwards from those constraints we start to enter much deeper and yet murkier territory. To make progress in this direction we have to leave what is safe to say and go towards speculation. The feeling of understand that grows within you as you start to think and think about why things were written a certain way also diminishes the ability to support those feelings with textual evidence. In essence, I assert but can't support that when you start thinking about Plato's writing and how they're supposed to work you yourself start to ascend from the material world to the forms the deeper you go.

The dialogues often times end without a meaningful conclusion or with much left unexplored. You begin to think through what it would even take to explore these different areas and realize that an exhaustive treatment of anything would still never satisfy the rigor of proof one may demand if they remain reluctant to act or change until they've had received a complete accounting of all the possible permutations. You begin to see as you simulate these unexplored scenarios the same problems that Plato might have been when writing the dialogue and understand that what is unsaid is oftentimes as important or even more important than what was said.

This makes sense given that most of Socrates' arguments are finding contradictions in something that has been asserted earlier. These arguments are valuable of course but they also feel like just an appetizer to the inevitable "well then what _is_ the truth" that one may ask oneself?

Even more concerning are the dialogues where a direct positive statement is asserted by Socrates himself. For example in Symposium when he posits what love is or in Republic and Laws where he defines justice. These positive assertions are valuable indeed but when one's become acquainted with the genre you know that these points are also just part of the story. The _real_ lessons are what happens in the reader's mind.

I'd like conclude this note with some remarks about eavesdropping and advocates but I don't have time to write my thoughts fully. I'll just say that eavesdropping let's you listen to someone else's problem which allows you to reflect what you would do differently without having a biased personal stake in whatever you're overhearing. Similarly, having an advocate in court is often times wanted not just because they may know the law better than you but often times because you benefit from someone else defending you just as a fact of human nature. What these two things have in common is that they're both impersonal.

Perhaps in the end one of the most important things to consider when asking what are Platonic dialogues is to consider a hypothetical alternative. Imagine instead Plato addresses the reader directly and says what they should do differently or think or believe. How effective would this be? There is a humanity to Plato's writings in the sense that he must have had a deep understanding of how they human mind works and what would give us the best chance of learning.

## From "The Older Sophists"

### From "79. Name and Notion"

The use of the word _sophist_ seems to have changed from pre-Socratic times. Many important "philosophers" (today's use of the word) of the day were referred as sophists by other writers. Additionally, the word _philosopher_ was used by Isocrates do describe orators such as himself and others with political skill. This reminds me of that passage in the Republic where there is shock at the suggestion that philosophers should rule. Socrates acknowledges his audience's apprehensions and blames society, dividing philosophers into two categories: vicious and useless. However Socrates himself was often referred to as a famous sophist in older writings.

In fact even Plato was called a sophist, although this may have been "by way of reproach".

> Does not Lysias [fr. 281 Orat.Att. 11 2i2a9] call Plato a “sophist,” and again Aeschines?

Lysias is connected with Plato by way of the Republic.

_Republic_ paints for us a solution to this dilemma. Sophists are those who use knowledge for its benefits whereas philosophers are those who truly love knowledge. In many ways the ostensible central question of _Republic_ concerning justice is analogous to this question of knowledge. Answers are hinted at throughout _Republic_ – I vaguely recall something along the lines of "if you love something you love all aspects of it" – but it may also be worthwhile to reflect on _Symposium_ as a more detailed treatment of the subject of love to understand what is meant by this.

_Euthyphro_ brings up a similar kind of conflict but about "the pious". The dialogue ends abruptly right as it feels like we're making progress, but one thread of the discussion before that was is if the gods love something because it is pious or whether something is pious because the gods love it. If I recall correctly the result was that it is not the case that the pious comes from the gods loving it.

Therefore we have something like this:

- Knowledge - loved by philosophers but philosophers don't create Knowledge simply by loving it
- Justice - loved by ? (the guardians? philosophers?) but valuable not for the benefits of seeming just but in its own right
- The Pious – loved by the gods

Back to the text

> No, I think that “sophist” was probably a general term, and “philosophy” had this meaning: a sort of love of the beautiful and study concerning discourse, and not this modern usage of the word, but culture in the universal sense

Further down, quoting Xenophon's _Memorabilia_

> the same with wisdom: those who sell it to anyone for money are called “sophists,” just like prostitutes.
